## Comparison Operators

## Stack
* _`Push [arg0 - any data type]`_  
Pushes `arg0` to stack
* _`PushFromAbs [index - integer>=0]`_  
Reads value at `index` on stack, pushes it, without removing original.
* _`PushRefFromAbs [index - integer>=0]`_  
Pushes reference to value at `index` on stack, without removing original.
* _`WriteToAbs [index - integer>=0]`_  
Pops a value from stack, writes it to `index` on stack.
* _`PushFrom [index - integer>=0]`_  
Reads value at `_stackIndex + index` on stack, pushes it, without removing original.
* _`PushRefFrom [index - integer>=0]`_  
Pushes reference to value at `_stackIndex + index` on stack, without removing original.
* _`WriteTo [index - integer>=0]`_  
Pops a value from stack, writes it to `_stackIndex + index` on stack.
* _`WriteToRef`_  
Pops a reference, then pops a value. Writes value to reference.
* _`Deref`_  
Pops a reference from stack. Pushes the value being referenced
* _`Pop`_  
Pops 1 value from stack
* _`PopN [n - integer>=0]`_  
Pops n number of values from stack

---

## Jumps
* _`Jump [jump position]`_  
Jump execution to instruction at `jump position`.
* _`JumpIf [jump position]`_  
Pops `bool` from stack. If it is `true`, jumps execution to instruction at `jump position`.
* _`JumpFrame [jump position]`_  
Jump execution to `jump position`. Pushes current frame to a separate stack, so `jumpBack` can be used to jump back.
Also changes `_stackIndex` to `_stack.count`.
* _`JumpBack`_  
Jump execution back to last pointer pushed to jump stack, & restores last frame pushed. `terminate`s if jump stack is empty.

---

## Arrays
* _`MakeArray [n - integer>0]`_  
Pops `n` number of elements from stack, puts them in an array (in the order they were added to stack). Pushes array to stack.
* _`ArrayRefElement`_  
Pops a reference to array, then an `index (integer>=0)`. Pushes reference-to-element at `index` on array.
* _`ArrayElement`_  
Pops an array, then an `index (integer>=0)`. Pushes reference-to-element at `index` on array.
* _`ArrayLength`_  
Pops an array. Pushes length of array (`integer>=0`) to stack.
* _`ArrayLengthSet`_  
Pops a reference to array, then `length (integer>=0)`. Sets length of array to `length`
* _`Concatenate`_  
Pops an array `a1` _(not reference)_, then pops another array `a2`. Pushes new array `a1 ~ a2`.
* _`AppendElement`_  
Pops a reference to array, then an element. Appends element at end of array.
* _`AppendArrayRef`_  
Pops reference to array `r1`, pops another `r2`. Then does `*r1 = *r1 ~ *r2`
* _`AppendArray`_  
Pops reference to array `r1`, then pops an array _(not reference)_. Then does `*r1 = *r1 ~ r2`
* _`copyArray`_  
Pops an array, makes a copy of it, pushes the copy to stack. Any changes made to copy won't reflect on original.  
**Will only work on 1 dimensional arrays.**
* _`copyArrayRef`_  
Pops a ref-to-array, makes a copy of array, pushes to stack. Any changes made to copy won't reflect on original.  
**Will only work on 1 dimensional arrays.**

Pops an integer from stack. Pushes a double with same value.
* _`IntToString`_  
Pops an integer from stack. Pushes a string representation of it.
* _`BoolToString`_  
Pops a bool from stack. Pushes `"true"` or `"false"` (string) depending on bool.
* _`DoubleToInt`_  
Pops a double from stack. Pushes integer part of it (as a integer) to stack.

## Misc.
* _`Terminate`_  
Terminates execution.

## D equivalent of data types in NaVM
* `integer` is a `long` or `int` depending on whether it is compiled for 64bit or 32bit.  or you could use `integer` from `misc.d` from package `utils`.
* `string` is a `dstring`
* `char` is a `dchar`
* `bool` is the same as a D `bool`
* arrays are `NaData[]` (stored in `NaData.arrayVal`).
